      "description": "The container is WAY too small. This is one of my favorite matchas though. The smell is nutty and toasty and the flavor is really inoffensive and easy to drink as a latte. It takes on the secondary flavor of whatever sweetener is used with it but in a way that it doesn't overwhelm the base flavor.",

      "description": "A floral umami honey flavor, this is a really nice and light matcha perfect for lattes. I'll also rank this as one of my favorite matchas for now since it's pretty lightly sweet, and the perfect matcha if you don't prefer bitter tea tastes. It's definitely on the smoother end as well and easy to foam up.",

      "description": "The can mentioned a walnut and lemon flavor, and I was surprised that it is an accurate reflection of the actual taste. Surprisingly despite having unique notes it's relatively easy to drink, so I think that this is a good foray into more unique-tasting matchas. It has a hint of sweetness so sweetener isn't necessary for this one, but it wouldn't overpower it if it was added.",

      "description": "Has a lighter, inoffensive, and very general flavor from matchas but is a great matcha for lattes. This is probably the perfect matcha if you are serving a large group since it doesn't lean into a certain taste. I hate the packaging though. I honestly prefer the matcha tins for packaging. I'm not sure why this is in single-use packaging when it's clearly not single-serving.",

It's not my favorite so far, but it does taste quite good and also has notes of nuttiness and creaminess. But to me I prefer a more tea-like bitter taste in my matcha and this tastes quite whole and sweet. It is though a solid Kettl matcha.",
